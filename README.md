# Berlin Clock Kata - Groupe 5 

## Description
The **Berlin Clock Kata** is a well-known exercise for practicing test-driven development (TDD) strategies. Itâ€™s designed to simulate the Berlin Clock, which displays time using a series of lamps with two possible states: on or off.

The Berlin Clock has the following structure:
- **Seconds Lamp**: A large round lamp at the top that lights up red on even seconds and turns off on odd seconds.
- **Hours**: Represented by two lines of red lamps.
  - The first line shows blocks of 5 hours, with 4 red lamps.
  - The second line shows blocks of 1 hour, with 4 red lamps.
- **Minutes**: Represented by two lines.
  - The top line shows blocks of 5 minutes, with 11 lamps: every third lamp is red, and the others are yellow.
  - The bottom line shows single minutes, with 4 yellow lamps.

The task is to convert a digital time (HH:MM:SS) into Berlin Clock format using TDD and pair programming.

In this project we choose to represent the red lights with 'R', the yellow ones with 'Y' and the ones that are not ON by a '0'.
